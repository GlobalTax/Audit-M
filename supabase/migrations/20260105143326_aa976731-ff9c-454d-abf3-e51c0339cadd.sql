SET content_en = '<p>The Spanish Commercial Registry (Registro Mercantil) is the official public registry where companies and commercial entities must record their legal and corporate information. Registration ensures legal personality, transparency, and public notice of key corporate actions — and is central to doing business in Spain.</p>

<h2>1. What Is the Commercial Registry?</h2>

<p>The Commercial Registry is a public register managed through provincial registries, coordinated with the Central Mercantile Registry (Registro Mercantil Central) in Madrid. Its main functions include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Providing legal certainty and transparency</strong> for companies</li>
<li><strong>Recording company formation</strong> and corporate acts</li>
<li><strong>Publishing official data</strong> in the Official Gazette of the Commercial Registry (BORME)</li>
<li><strong>Issuing certificates and extracts</strong> for legal, commercial, and financial purposes</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Mandatory Registration — When and Who</h2>

<p>All commercial companies in Spain (e.g., Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (S.L.), Sociedad Anónima (S.A.)) must be registered in the provincial Commercial Registry corresponding to their registered address.</p>

<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Branches of foreign companies</strong> operating in Spain are also required to register in the relevant provincial registry</li>
<li><strong>For individual entrepreneurs</strong>, registration is optional but often advisable for legal certainty and credibility</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Name Reservation (Central Registry Requirement)</h2>

<p>Before incorporation, the company must obtain a <strong>Name Availability Certificate</strong> (Certificado de Denominación Negativa) from the Central Mercantile Registry confirming the chosen name does not conflict with existing registered names.</p>

<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Up to <strong>three name options</strong> may be submitted</li>
<li>The certificate <strong>reserves the name for six months</strong>, with three months to execute the incorporation deed</li>
<li>The company''s name in the deed must <strong>exactly match</strong> the certified name</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Essential Documents for Registration</h2>

<p>To register a company successfully, the following documentation is typically required:</p>

<ul>
<li>✔ <strong>Deed of Incorporation</strong> (Escritura Pública) signed before a Spanish notary</li>
<li>✔ <strong>Articles of Association</strong> (Estatutos Sociales) defining internal governance</li>
<li>✔ <strong>Certificate of Share Capital Deposit</strong>, e.g., minimum of €3,000 for an S.L. (bank-issued)</li>
<li>✔ <strong>Tax Identification Number</strong> (NIF/CIF) — provisional at first, then definitive</li>
<li>✔ <strong>Identification of shareholders and directors</strong></li>
<li>✔ <strong>Economic Activity Declaration</strong> (Model 036/037) for tax purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>These documents are filed with the notary and forwarded to the Commercial Registry for examination and registration.</p>

<h2>5. Legal Personality and Registration Effects</h2>

<p>A company acquires legal personality only once its deed is registered at the Commercial Registry. This is a critical legal requirement: <strong>companies are not fully operative in public law until this point</strong>.</p>

<p>Registration also enables the limited liability of shareholders and protects the company''s rights in legal and commercial transactions.</p>

<h2>6. Post-Incorporation Filing Obligations</h2>

<p>Once registered, companies must regularly file material corporate documents:</p>

<h3>Annual Accounts (Cuentas Anuales)</h3>
<p>Companies must file their annual financial statements within the legal deadline following the close of their financial year. Filing annual accounts ensures transparency and compliance, and <strong>failure to file can lead to fines or sanctions</strong>.</p>

<h3>Corporate Acts and Changes</h3>
<p>Changes in directors, capital increases/reductions, registered address changes, appointments of proxies or agents, and other relevant corporate actions must be notarised and filed with the Commercial Registry.</p>

<h3>Legalisation of Books</h3>
<p>Statutory accounting books, minutes books, ledgers and records need to be legalised through the Registry, often annually or as required by law.</p>

<h2>7. Access to Public Information</h2>

<p>The Commercial Registry is a public source of corporate information. The following are typical documents and services offered:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nota Simple Mercantil</strong> (Uncertified Extract): Summary of basic company data</li>
<li><strong>Certificación Registral</strong>: Official certified information for legal and banking purposes</li>
<li><strong>Ownership and Director Data</strong>: Details on directors, registered office, share capital, and more</li>
</ul>

<p>Obtaining certificates usually involves a small fee and can be done online through the Registrars'' official portal.</p>

<h2>8. Special Notes for Foreign Entities</h2>

<p>Branch offices of foreign companies must be registered in the Mercantile Registry to operate legally in Spain. These require:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation of the parent company</strong> (officially legalised and translated)</li>
<li><strong>Appointing a legal representative</strong> in Spain</li>
<li><strong>Securities or tax IDs</strong> as required by Spanish authorities</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Practical Compliance Checklist for 2026</h2>

<ul>
<li>✔ <strong>Reserve your company name</strong> with the Central Mercantile Registry</li>
<li>✔ <strong>Draft and notarise incorporation documents</strong></li>
<li>✔ <strong>Obtain provisional and definitive NIF</strong></li>
<li>✔ <strong>Register with the provincial Commercial Registry</strong> within the legal period</li>
<li>✔ <strong>File annual accounts and legalised books</strong> on time</li>
