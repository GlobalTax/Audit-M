SET content_en = '<p>As 2026 begins, several labour law developments approved in 2025 come into force or continue unfolding in Spain. These changes affect work-life balance, parental rights, workplace compliance and labour market regulation. Below is a practical, factual update for employers, HR professionals and legal practitioners.</p>

<h2>1. Mandatory Digital Time Recording for All Employers</h2>

<p>From 2026, Spain strengthens its digital time-tracking regime. All companies must implement digital systems to record the start and end of daily work, including breaks. The objective is to increase transparency and reduce undeclared overtime.</p>

<p><strong>Key points for compliance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Daily logging of working hours for every employee</li>
<li>Records must be accessible for inspection and retained for audit-ready compliance</li>
<li>Some proposals envisage significant fines per affected employee for non-compliance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What this means in practice:</strong> Employers should already have digital solutions in place or be ready to adopt them before inspections become more stringent.</p>

<h2>2. Expansion of Parental Leave — 19 Weeks from January 1, 2026</h2>

<p>One of the most significant social rights changes is the extension of paid parental leave. Workers with children born after August 2024 are entitled to 19 weeks of fully paid birth and childcare leave starting in 2026.</p>

<p><strong>Impacts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both parents benefit from additional weeks of paid leave</li>
<li>Improves work-life balance and aligns Spanish family benefits with broader European standards</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Intern Labour Contracts and "Estatuto del Becario" (Internship Statute)</h2>

<p>2026 is expected to see the implementation of a specific statute regulating internships and training contracts, clarifying conditions under the Workers'' Statute. The Government approved regulations developing the framework for training contracts.</p>

<p><strong>This reform aims to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Combat misuse of internship contracts</li>
<li>Set clear rules for alternating work and study</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Weekly Working Hours Debate & Legislative Process</h2>

<p>The proposal to reduce the maximum weekly workweek from 40 to 37.5 hours remains a key debated initiative with expected effects around 2026. The Spanish Government approved a bill headed to Parliament to cut the standard workweek without reducing pay.</p>

<p><strong>Status (as of late 2025):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The proposal has government backing but still requires parliamentary approval</li>
<li>Its final form in 2026 will depend on political negotiations and agreement with social partners</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Employers should monitor this closely:</strong> If the reform becomes law, collective agreements and HR policies must be adjusted.</p>

<h2>5. Pay Transparency Directive Implementation</h2>

<p>Spain is set to implement the EU Pay Transparency Directive, which will require:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greater transparency in pay structures</li>
<li>Strengthened rights for employees to access comparative pay data</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the full legislative text is yet to be published, implementation is anticipated around 2026.</p>

<h2>6. Labour Inspection Strategic Plan 2025–2027</h2>

<p>Spain published a Strategic Plan for the Labour and Social Security Inspectorate covering 2025–2027, which emphasizes enforcement in key areas including hiring practices, working hours and workplace conditions.</p>

<p><strong>What to expect in 2026:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Proactive audits on time recording and contracts</li>
<li>Focus on regulatory compliance rather than reactive enforcement</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. 2026 Declared as "Year of Health & Safety at Work"</h2>

<p>In 2025 the Government declared 2026 as the official Year of Health and Safety at Work to mark the 30th anniversary of the Occupational Risk Prevention Law and stimulate action by employers.</p>

<p><strong>This signals enhanced attention to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Workplace risk prevention</li>
<li>Psychosocial hazards</li>
<li>Compliance with safety protocols</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Labour Calendar and Festivities</h2>

<p>For planning and compliance purposes, Spain''s 2026 statutory public holidays include nine nationwide dates such as New Year''s Day, Labour Day and Christmas.</p>

<p><strong>Why this matters for employers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Legal obligations to publish the annual work calendar</li>
<li>Proper planning of shifts, rest periods and pay calculations around holidays</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical Checklist for 2026 (Compliance Priorities)</h2>

<ul>
<li>✔ <strong>Implement or upgrade digital time tracking</strong> — system must record daily hours and retain data</li>
<li>✔ <strong>Prepare internal policies for extended parental leave</strong></li>
<li>✔ <strong>Adapt HR templates for internship and training contracts</strong></li>
<li>✔ <strong>Monitor workweek legislation developments</strong></li>
