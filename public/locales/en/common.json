        "obligatorio": {
          "question": "When is an auditor's report mandatory for a grant?",
          "answer": "It's mandatory when the call explicitly requires it, when the amount exceeds certain thresholds (generally €60,000 for expenses and/or €150,000 in grants), or when the granting body determines so. Additionally, for PRTR funds it's almost always mandatory."
        },
        "simplificada": {
          "question": "What's the difference between simplified and audited justification accounts?",
          "answer": "Simplified accounts only require a declaration and invoices, while audited accounts include a review report by a ROAC-registered auditor who verifies expense eligibility and compliance with the rules."
        },
        "prtrIncumplimiento": {
          "question": "What happens if I don't correctly justify a PRTR grant?",
          "answer": "Non-compliance with PRTR justification may result in full grant reimbursement plus late interest. It could also mean exclusion from future calls and, in serious cases, additional liabilities."
        },
        "dnsh": {
          "question": "What is the DNSH principle and how does it affect my grant?",
          "answer": "DNSH (Do No Significant Harm) means investments funded with European funds cannot cause significant environmental damage. It's mandatory for PRTR and non-compliance is grounds for full reimbursement."
        },
        "coste": {
          "question": "How much does a grant audit cost?",
          "answer": "The cost depends on project complexity, grant amount and documentation to review. Generally ranges from €1,500 to €8,000. We offer no-obligation quotes tailored to each case."
        },
        "documentacion": {
          "question": "What documentation do I need to prepare?",
          "answer": "You'll need: grant resolution, approved budget, invoices and payment receipts, supplier contracts, bank statements, DACI declarations, and project technical documentation as per the call."
        },
        "tiempo": {
          "question": "How long does a grant audit take?",
          "answer": "Depends on documentation volume, but usually 2 to 4 weeks from receiving all documentation. It's important to plan ahead regarding justification deadlines."
        },
        "irregularidades": {
          "question": "What happens if the body detects irregularities?",
          "answer": "If there are irregularities, the body may request additional documentation, apply partial financial corrections or, in serious cases, demand full reimbursement. A prior audit helps detect and correct issues before submission."
